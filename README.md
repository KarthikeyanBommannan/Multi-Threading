# Multi-Threading

In this code snippet we are fetching crypto currency live market data and uploading the data to mongodb,by the concept of multi threading we are collecting data's of BITCOIN,ETHERUM,SOLANA,TETHER and BITCOIN CASH crypto currency live market data.In this I'm collecting 10800 data with delay time of 2 seconds,it's going to take 9 hours to collect the data for 1 currency,but here its only taking 9 hours to collect the data of 5 currency.we are in the concept of multi threading.In a regular function call,one function is completely executed then only the second function is going to run likewise for the remaining 4 function, if we are doing that way the cost of collecting data is expensive that's why we are introducing the concept of multithreading,which is cost effective way to collecting the data.
